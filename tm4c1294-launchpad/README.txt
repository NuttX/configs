README
======

  This is a placeholder for the README file for a forthcoming port to the
  tm4c1294 Launchpad (more correctly, th ek-tm4c124xl).

Serial Console
==============

  These configurations use UART0 for the serial console.  UART0 is connected
  to the on-board TM4C123G-based debugger and is forwarded through the ICDI
  virtual UART.
