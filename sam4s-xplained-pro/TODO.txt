 - implement flash driver
   - see arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_flash.c and related
     - both banks could be mapped with care taken not to erase the active code. 
       - perhaps the MPU could block code corruption?
       
   - once implemented, the free() cmd replacement can show flash information. 

 - Seen crashes when running serial ports below 921600
 - USB serial not quite stable when pushing lots of data
 
 - UARTs don't use DMA. We may need this for high baudrates.
   - Inbound hardware flow control requires dma.
